This folder contains Google's Android synthesizer code demo which modeled after the famous
Yamaha DX7 synthesizer. 

The project is available at https://github.com/google/music-synthesizer-for-android.

Google seems no longer updating the code base, and there's active development happening at 
https://github.com/asb2m10/dexed. I update the existing code to the Dexed version, and
make changes to synth_unit accordingly.
